## Setup Instructions

### 1. File Structure
Place all files in your web server directory:
```
admin/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ act-status.js
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rc-costs.js
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blockchain-status.js
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payment-channels.js
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ admin-users.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### 2. Web Server Configuration
- Serve the `admin/` directory via HTTP/HTTPS
- Ensure the backend API is accessible from the same domain
- No build process required - runs directly in the browser

### 3. Backend Requirements
Your API must have the following endpoints:
- `GET /api/onboarding/auth/challenge` - Get authentication challenge
- `GET /api/onboarding/auth/whoami` - Verify authentication
- `GET /api/onboarding/admin/*` - Various admin endpoints

### 4. Admin User Setup
1. Use the API directly to add your first admin user:
```bash
# This is typically done automatically when the system starts
# The username from config.username becomes the first super admin
```

2. Or use the database directly:
```sql
INSERT INTO admin_users (username, permissions, added_by)
VALUES ('your-hive-username', '{"admin": true, "super": true}', 'system');
```

## Usage

- Session tokens have 24-hour expiration
- Admin privileges verified on each request

### Access Control
- Only verified admin users can access the dashboard
- Super admin permissions required for user management
- Self-protection prevents accidental lockout
- All admin actions are logged

### Data Protection
- All API calls use HTTPS in production
- Sensitive data is not logged in browser console
- Session data stored securely in localStorage
- Authentication headers properly secured

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Hive Keychain not found"
- Install the Hive Keychain browser extension
- Ensure it's enabled and unlocked
- Refresh the page and try again

#### "Admin privileges required"
- Verify your Hive username is in the admin_users table
- Check that your admin status is active
- Contact existing super admin to add you

#### "Authentication failed"
- Check that your system clock is accurate
- Ensure Keychain is unlocked and functioning
- Try refreshing and logging in again

#### API Errors
- Verify the backend service is running
- Check browser console for network errors
- Ensure CORS is properly configured
- Verify API endpoints are accessible

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with ES6+ support
- JavaScript enabled
- LocalStorage available
- Fetch API support

### Performance Tips
- Charts may lag with large datasets
- Use date filters to limit data loads
- Refresh periodically for latest data
- Close unused browser tabs to free memory

## Development

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3, Bootstrap 5, Chart.js
- **Authentication**: Hive Keychain integration
- **Charts**: Chart.js with responsive design
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS variables

### Customization
- Edit CSS variables in `index.html` for theming
- Modify component templates for layout changes
- Add new endpoints by extending the API client
- Create new components following the existing pattern

### Contributing
1. Test thoroughly with real admin credentials
